# Tasks: SSH鍵管理機能

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-ssh-key-management/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: TDDアプローチに基づきテストを含む（Constitution III. Test-First）

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Mobile (Flutter)**: `lib/`, `test/` at repository root

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and dependency setup

- [x] T001 Add dependencies to pubspec.yaml: file_picker, cryptography, pointycastle
- [x] T002 Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Verify flutter analyze passes with new dependencies

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Benefits from US1/US2 for test data
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US3 for list display

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Service methods before screen integration
- Core implementation before UI polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- T003 can run in parallel during Setup
- T007 can run in parallel during Foundational
- T013, T014, T015 can run in parallel (all US1 tests)
- T026, T027, T028 can run in parallel (all US2 tests)
- US1 and US2 can theoretically run in parallel (both P1)
- T051, T052, T055 can run in parallel during Polish

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Unit test for Ed25519 key generation in test/services/keychain/ssh_key_service_test.dart"
Task: "Unit test for RSA key generation in test/services/keychain/ssh_key_service_test.dart"
Task: "Unit test for PEM format conversion in test/services/keychain/ssh_key_service_test.dart"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (鍵生成)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test key generation independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP - 鍵生成可能!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (インポート可能!)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (一覧表示改善!)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (削除可能!)
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Recommended Order

US1とUS2は両方P1だが、US1（生成）を先に完了することを推奨:
- US1でSshKeyServiceの基盤が完成する
- US2はUS1のtoPem/calculateFingerprintを再利用できる

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Security: Never log private key content, clear sensitive data after use
